            <p>Segmented controls are used for quickly selecting between a small set of mutually exclusive options.
  
              Segmented Controls work like a group of radio inputs in that no more than one may be selected at a time. Use this component for scenarios where there are only a few options. If you need to present a lot of options to the user, consider using another component such as Select.</p>
